               <p>As a lifelong learner, I am both proud and fortunate enough to be involved in the field of education for the last several years.  I have earned my undergraduate degree in teaching from The Pennsylvania State University and even grew up on my Grandfather's farm not too far from the University.  Upon graduating, I moved to Fairfax, VA, where I was an instructor for 4 years. I have taught in New Jersey for 2 years after that, before moving into project management. </p>
